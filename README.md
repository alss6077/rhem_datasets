Uncertainty-aware Receding Horizon Exploration and Mapping with Aerial Robots Open Datasets.

This repository contains links and configuration files for Datasets that were collected by employing the "*Uncertainty-aware Receding Horizon Exploration and Mapping*" planner:
 
* Two (2) "*Indoor Exploration under Ambient Illumination"* datasets, one in an open-center-space environment, and one in a cluttered scene. 
* An "*Indoor Exploration under Ambient Illumination"* dataset which additionally contains Time-of-Flight sensor data.
* An "*Indoor Exploration in Darkness"* dataset which is conducted in the same environment in conditions of pure darkness. Visual information is supported by onboard illumination and depth perception by a Time-of-Flight sensor.
* An "*Exploration of Underground Tunnel in Darkness"* dataset which corresponds to a field deployment in a Degraded Visual Environment (an underground railroad tunnel). A three (3) Time-of-Flight sensor array provides half-dome depth perception, while onboard illumination supports Visual information which is degraded by darkness and dust.

**The planner is open sourced and can be retrieved at:**  https://github.com/unr-arl/rhem_planner .
